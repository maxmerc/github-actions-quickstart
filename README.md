# github-actions-quickstart
## FEEDBACK-1 Text
Overall, the documentation was extremely helpful for showing how to create a GitHub action, but more importantly, what you can do with GitHub actions (trigger a workflow, checkout repo code, and see various environment labels). 
One thing you could do better, however, is provide a helpful link on how to 'create a .github/workflows directory in your repository'. 
As someone who is new to this, like myself, I had to look up another one of GitHub's documentations, so if you could directly show that or link the other article that would've been appreciated.
